im trying to deploy my mern project on render.com. it works fine on my laptop

but 
error log when im trying to deploy on render is:
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/opt/render/project/src/server/build/index.html'

See clarifications below

Start script: "node src/index.js",
index.js is server/src/index.js
project root is server/build/index.html
